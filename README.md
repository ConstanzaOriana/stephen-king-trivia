Building an interactive trivia game for Stephen King's fans!
Users can auto-test their knowledge in horror books and movies by choosing between several options and
know their result based on his choices once they finish answering all questions.
This site allowed me to learn and practise JavaScript, EventListeners, DOM, localStorage and JSON from scratch.
Loved every minute I worked on it!
